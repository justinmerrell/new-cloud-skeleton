# Cloud Class

This class calls some service catalog functions and contains code that checks FluffyCloud credentials. Many of the functions in this class are also straightforward to implement.

Start by creating a copy of `fluffycloud/fluffycloud.py` and place it at `sky/clouds/fluffycloud.py`

## Credentials file

The credentials file contains the users credentials required to access your cloud.
