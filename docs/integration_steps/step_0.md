# Cloud Python Library Coverage

This document is primarily for the mantainers of python libaries for their perspective cloud. It provides a list of functions that SkyPilot will need, by integrating these functions into your python library you can drastically reduce the amount of work and complexity needed to add your cloud to SkyPilot.

## Function List

1. Launch an instance
2. Remove an instance
3. Set instance tags
4. List instances

## API Wrapper/Middleware
